# DualExecutorJ

**DualExecutorJ** is a Java application that allows running two processes simultaneously with a single `java -jar` command.

Specifically created for Pterodactyl hosting users who need to run multiple servers in one container.

## Overview

DualExecutorJ manages two concurrent processes:
- A background process (e.g., a game server)
- A foreground process (e.g., a shell or another server)

The application handles:
- Process input/output management
- Graceful shutdown of both processes
- Configurable working directories and commands
- Console input forwarding to the foreground process
- Background process output monitoring

## Configuration

Create a `config.properties` file in the application directory. Example:

```
properties
backgroundCommand=java --version
backgroundWorkDir=.
foregroundCommand=bash
foregroundWorkDir=.
```

- `backgroundCommand`: Command to run in the background
- `backgroundWorkDir`: Working directory for the background process
- `foregroundCommand`: Command to run in the foreground
- `foregroundWorkDir`: Working directory for the foreground process

If no configuration file is found, the application will create one with default values.

## Building

The project uses Gradle for building. To build the application:

```
bash
java -jar app/build/libs/DualExecutorJ.jar
```
